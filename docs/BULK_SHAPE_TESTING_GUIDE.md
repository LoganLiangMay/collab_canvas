## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

| Shape Count | Batches | Creation Time | Post-Creation FPS | Status |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| 100         | 1       | <2s           | 55+ FPS          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| 200         | 1       | <3s           | 50+ FPS          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| 500         | 1       | <5s           | 45+ FPS          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| 1000        | 2       | <10s          | 30+ FPS          | ‚úÖ Pass |
| 2000        | 4       | <20s          | 20+ FPS          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable |
| 5000+       | 10+     | <60s          | 10-20 FPS        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Sluggish |

### Firebase Optimization

- **Batch Size**: 500 operations per batch (Firebase limit)
- **Optimistic Update**: All shapes added to local state immediately
- **Firestore Sync**: Batches committed sequentially
- **Cost Efficiency**: 1 batch = 1 write operation (not N writes)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Canvas Performance**: 1000+ shapes may cause rendering lag
2. **Firestore Free Tier**: 20K writes/day limit (40 bulk requests of 500 shapes)
3. **No Viewport Culling**: All shapes render even if off-screen
4. **No Undo for Bulk**: Undo/redo doesn't support bulk operations yet
5. **Max Count**: Hard limit of 10,000 shapes per request

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Modal doesn't appear for 100+ shapes
**Solution**: Check console for detection logs. Ensure command includes number ‚â•100.

### Issue: Shapes created without confirmation
**Solution**: Check if count is <100 (no confirmation needed). Verify modal state in React DevTools.

### Issue: Firebase batch errors
**Solution**: 
- Check Firestore rules (write permissions)
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check Firebase quotas (free tier limits)

### Issue: Slow creation (>30s for 1000 shapes)
**Solution**:
- Check network speed
- Verify Firebase region (should be US/EU for low latency)
- Clear browser cache and retry

### Issue: FPS drops below 20 after bulk creation
**Solution**:
- Expected for 1000+ shapes
- Clear canvas or delete some shapes
- Use `Cmd/Ctrl+A` ‚Üí Delete to clear all
