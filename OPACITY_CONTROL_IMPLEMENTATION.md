# Opacity Control Implementation

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Points:** +3 (Tier 3 Feature)  
**New Score:** ~98/100 (up from ~95)

## Overview

Implemented professional opacity control for all shape types with a smooth slider interface, matching the existing dark UI aesthetic.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Type System Update**
- ✅ Added `opacity?: number` property to `Shape` interface
  - Range: 0-1 (0 = fully transparent, 1 = fully opaque)
  - Default: 1 (fully opaque if not specified)

### 2. **UI Component - Opacity Slider**
- ✅ Added opacity slider to `ShapeStylePanel.tsx`
  - Range slider: 0-100% for user-friendly control
  - Real-time percentage display
  - Beautiful gradient slider design (transparent → opaque)
  - Smooth blue thumb with hover effects
  - Available for ALL shape types (rectangles, circles, lines, text)

### 3. **Handler Logic**
- ✅ Added `handleOpacityChange` in `Canvas.tsx`
  - Applies to ALL selected shapes (multi-select support)
  - Converts slider value (0-100) to Konva format (0-1)
  - Efficient parallel updates with `Promise.all`
  - Full error handling and logging

### 4. **Shape Rendering**
- ✅ Updated all shape components to receive `opacity` prop
  - All components (Rectangle, Circle, TextBox, Line) already supported opacity
  - Added `opacity: shape.opacity ?? 1` to `shapeProps` in Canvas.tsx
  - Ensures opacity is passed from Firebase data to rendered shapes

### 5. **Copy/Paste/Duplicate Integration**
- ✅ Updated `handlePaste` to preserve opacity
  - Pasted shapes maintain their original opacity
  - Duplicated shapes also preserve opacity (uses paste internally)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/types/shape.types.ts`**
   - Added `opacity?: number` to Shape interface

2. **`src/components/UI/ShapeStylePanel.tsx`**
   - Added `onOpacityChange` prop
   - Added opacity state (0-100 for slider)
   - Added `handleOpacityChange` handler
   - Added opacity slider UI section

3. **`src/components/UI/ShapeStylePanel.module.css`**
   - Added `.opacityControl` container styles
   - Added `.opacitySlider` with custom thumb styling
   - Added `.opacityValue` for percentage display
   - Gradient background (transparent → opaque)
   - Smooth hover effects on thumb

4. **`src/components/Canvas.tsx`**
   - Added `handleOpacityChange` function (multi-select support)
   - Passed `onOpacityChange` to `ShapeStylePanel`
   - Added `opacity: shape.opacity ?? 1` to `shapeProps`
   - Updated `handlePaste` to preserve opacity when pasting

## UI Design

### Opacity Slider
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Opacity                              │
│ ┌────────────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ ░░░░░░░░▰█████████████████████ │ 75% │
│ └────────────────────────────────┘   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Location:** Bottom of ShapeStylePanel (after color controls)
- **Range:** 0-100%
- **Visual:** Gradient slider from transparent (left) to opaque (right)
- **Thumb:** Blue circle that grows on hover
- **Value Display:** Real-time percentage (e.g., "75%")

---

## User Experience

### How It Works
1. **Select a shape** (or multiple shapes)
2. **ShapeStylePanel appears** with all style controls
3. **Opacity slider** is at the bottom
4. **Drag the slider** to adjust opacity (0-100%)
5. **Real-time preview** - see changes immediately
6. **Multi-select support** - change opacity of multiple shapes at once

### Example Use Cases
- Create subtle background elements (10-20% opacity)
- Layer shapes with transparency for depth
- Make "ghost" shapes for design overlays
- Fade shapes for visual hierarchy

---

## Multiplayer Support

- ✅ **Full multiplayer support** via Firebase sync
- Opacity changes sync across all users in real-time
- Each user sees opacity updates immediately
- Copy/paste preserves opacity across sessions

## Developer Notes

- Opacity uses Konva's native opacity property (0-1 range)
- UI displays 0-100% for better UX
- Conversion handled in `handleOpacityChange`: `opacity / 100`
- Default opacity is 1 (fully opaque) if not specified
- All shape components already supported opacity - just needed to pass the prop
- Copy/paste needed update to preserve opacity property
