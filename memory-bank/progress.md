## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Bugs
None actively blocking development.

### Technical Debt
1. **Shape data model for lines**
   - Current: Uses x, y, width, height for all shapes
   - Lines need: start point (x1, y1) and end point (x2, y2)
   - Current workaround: Map (x, y) to start, (x+width, y+height) to end
   - Future: Consider adding `points` array to Shape interface

2. **Single canvas limitation**
   - Hardcoded `global-canvas-v1` canvas ID
   - No multi-canvas support yet
   - Database schema assumes one canvas

3. **Firebase free tier limits**
   - Realtime DB: 100 simultaneous connections
   - Firestore: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
   - Need monitoring and rate limiting for scaling

4. **No viewport culling**
   - All shapes render even if off-screen
   - Performance may degrade with 1000+ shapes
   - Future: Implement viewport-based rendering

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Optimistic updates** - Users experience instant feedback
2. **Object locking** - Prevents jarring conflicts in multiplayer
3. **Separate Konva layers** - Excellent performance optimization
4. **React.memo** - Reduced unnecessary re-renders significantly
5. **Firebase Realtime DB for cursors** - Low latency is crucial
6. **Development branch strategy** - Protects production

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Shape data model** - Early decision to use x,y,width,height limits flexibility
2. **Testing coverage** - Mostly manual testing, need more automated tests
3. **Error handling** - Added late, should be built in from start
4. **Documentation** - Should maintain as we build, not at the end

### Key Takeaways
- Real-time collaboration is hard but achievable
- Performance optimization is critical for good UX
- User feedback (toasts, visual indicators) makes multiplayer intuitive
- Firebase is excellent for rapid prototyping
- TypeScript strict mode catches bugs early
