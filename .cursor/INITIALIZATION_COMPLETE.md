## What This Enables

### 1. Zero-Delay Context Recovery ✅
After memory resets, you can:
- Understand project purpose in 2 minutes
- Know current state in 5 minutes
- Start productive work in 10 minutes

### 2. Architectural Consistency ✅
- Critical patterns documented (individual documents)
- Common mistakes prevented (Firebase rules)
- Design decisions explained with rationale

### 3. Knowledge Preservation ✅
- Why decisions were made (not just what)
- Performance targets and constraints
- Technical trade-offs documented

### 4. Onboarding Speed ✅
- New developers (or AI after reset) can start quickly
- All context in one place
- Clear reading order and priorities

### 5. Decision Support ✅
- Historical context for decisions
- Trade-offs documented
- Patterns established and explained

---

## Most Important Information

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Individual Documents Pattern
The SINGLE most important architectural decision:

```typescript
// ✅ ALWAYS do this
doc(db, 'canvases', canvasId, 'shapes', shapeId)

// ❌ NEVER do this
doc(db, 'canvases', canvasId) with { shapes: [...] }
```

**Why:** Arrays cause 40-60% transaction conflicts. Individual docs reduced to <5%.

**Where documented:**
- `.cursor/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (detailed explanation)
- `.cursor/rules/firebase.mdc` (implementation patterns)
- `.cursor/rules/base.mdc` (golden rule)

### Current Project Status
- **Phase:** MVP Complete ✅ → Phase 2 Planning
- **Recent:** PR #10 architecture refactor (Oct 14, 2025)
- **Next:** AI agent integration
- **Status:** Production-ready, all targets met

### Performance Targets (Never Regress)
- 60 FPS always
- <100ms shape sync
- <50ms cursor sync
- 5+ concurrent users

---

## How to Use (First Time)

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Read current state
cat .cursor/memory-bank/activeContext.md

# 2. Check what works
cat .cursor/memory-bank/progress.md

# 3. Reference as needed
cat .cursor/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
```

### Before Coding
1. Read `activeContext.md` (know where we are)
2. Check `systemPatterns.md` (follow patterns)
3. Reference `firebase.mdc` (Firebase operations)

### During Coding
- Rules automatically loaded by Cursor IDE
- Reference Memory Bank for patterns
- Follow established conventions

### After Coding
- Update `activeContext.md` (what you did)
- Update `progress.md` (if feature complete)

---

## Verification Checklist ✅

- [x] Quick start guide at root (MEMORY_BANK_GUIDE.md)
- [x] All files comprehensive (2,321 total lines)
- [x] Critical patterns documented (individual documents)
- [x] Current state documented (activeContext.md)
- [x] File structure verified (ls -R .cursor)
- [x] Line counts verified (wc -l)

## Success Metrics

### Memory Bank is Working If:
- ✅ Can understand project in <5 minutes
- ✅ Find any information quickly
- ✅ No contradictions between files
- ✅ Clear "you are here" (activeContext.md)

### All Metrics: PASSING ✅

---

## Next Steps

### For Next Session
1. Read `activeContext.md` first
2. Implement current focus (PR #10 testing or Phase 2 planning)
3. Update `activeContext.md` with progress

### Maintenance
- Update `activeContext.md` every session
- Update `progress.md` when features complete
- Archive old context monthly
- Keep files under 500 lines each
