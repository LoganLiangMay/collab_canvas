## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cd /Applications/Gauntlet/collab_canvas/collabcanvas
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

3. Get API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

⚠️ **Important**: 
- Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in .gitignore)
- Use restricted API keys for security
- Keys are billing-sensitive - handle with care

### Step 2: Start Development Server

```bash
cd /Applications/Gauntlet/collab_canvas/collabcanvas
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

### Step 3: Test AI Commands

The AI chat window appears in the bottom-right corner.

**Try These Commands**:

#### Simple Creation
- "create a red circle"
- "add a blue rectangle"
- "make a text that says Hello World"

#### Manipulation
- "move the red circle to the center"
- "resize the blue rectangle to be twice as big"
- "rotate the text 45 degrees"

#### Layout
- "arrange all shapes in a horizontal row"
- "create a grid of 3x3 squares"
- "align all circles to the left"

#### Complex Operations
- "create a login form with username and password fields"
- "build a navigation bar with 4 menu items"
- "make a card layout with title, image, and description"

### Step 4: Expand Chat History

Click the header or chevron icon to expand/collapse the conversation history.

### Step 5: Multi-User Testing

Open multiple browser windows to test that AI-created shapes appear for all users in real-time.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AI features require OpenAI API key"
**Solution**: Add `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and restart dev server

### "Invalid OpenAI API key"
**Solution**: 
- Check key format (starts with `sk-`)
- Verify key is active in OpenAI dashboard
- Ensure billing is set up

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: 
- Wait a moment and try again
- Check OpenAI usage limits
- Consider upgrading OpenAI plan

### "No shapes found matching: [identifier]"
**Solution**:
- Be more specific: "red circle" not just "circle"
- Use "selected", "last", or "all" for clarity
- Create shapes first before manipulating

### Commands not working as expected
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Review conversation history for AI responses
- Try rephrasing command
- Use example commands as templates
