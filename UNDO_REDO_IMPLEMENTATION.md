# Undo/Redo System Implementation

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive Undo/Redo system using the Command Pattern to track shape operations (create, update, delete) with keyboard shortcuts and UI buttons.

## Implementation Details

### 1. History Management Hook (`useHistory.ts`)

Created a custom React hook that manages undo/redo state:

**Features**:
- Command pattern with history entries tracking before/after states
- Support for Create, Update, and Delete operations
- Undo and Redo stacks (max 50 entries)
- Prevents recording during undo/redo operations to avoid recursion
- Type-safe with TypeScript

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  type: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  shapeId: string;
  before: Shape | null; // null for create
  after: Shape | null;  // null for delete
  timestamp: number;
}
```

**API**:
```typescript
{
  canUndo: boolean;
  canRedo: boolean;
  undo: () => HistoryEntry | null;
  redo: () => HistoryEntry | null;
  recordCreate: (shape: Shape) => void;
  recordUpdate: (before: Shape, after: Shape) => void;
  recordDelete: (shape: Shape) => void;
  clear: () => void;
}
```

### 2. Canvas Integration

**Wrapper Functions**:
Created history-aware wrapper functions in `Canvas.tsx`:
- `createShape()` - Wraps `createShapeFirestore` and records creation
- `updateShape()` - Wraps `updateShapeFirestore` and records before/after states
- `deleteShape()` - Wraps `deleteShapeFirestore` and records deletion

**Undo/Redo Handlers**:
- `handleUndo()` - Reverses last operation with toast feedback
- `handleRedo()` - Re-applies last undone operation with toast feedback

**Operation Logic**:
- **Undo Create** → Delete the shape
- **Undo Update** → Restore previous state
- **Undo Delete** → Recreate the shape
- **Redo** → Opposite of undo

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts

Implemented cross-platform keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action | Platform |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `Cmd+Z` / `Ctrl+Z` | Undo | Mac / Windows |
| `Cmd+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo | Mac / Windows |
| `Cmd+Y` / `Ctrl+Y` | Redo (alternative) | Mac / Windows |

**Features**:
- Disabled during text editing to avoid conflicts
- Prevents browser default behaviors
- Works anywhere in the canvas

### 4. UI Buttons (LeftSidebar)

Added two new buttons below the Cursor Mode button:

**Undo Button**:
- Icon: `Undo2` from lucide-react
- Enabled when `canUndo === true`
- Disabled (grayed out) when nothing to undo
- Tooltip: "Undo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z)" or "Nothing to undo"

**Redo Button**:
- Icon: `Redo2` from lucide-react
- Enabled when `canRedo === true`
- Disabled (grayed out) when nothing to redo
- Tooltip: "Redo (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z)" or "Nothing to redo"

**Visual States**:
- Active: Full opacity, clickable
- Disabled: Reduced opacity, not clickable
- Matches existing toolbar button styling

## Files Modified

1. **Created**:
   - `/collabcanvas/src/hooks/useHistory.ts` - History management hook

2. **Modified**:
   - `/collabcanvas/src/components/Canvas.tsx`
     - Added useHistory hook import and integration
     - Created wrapper functions for create/update/delete
     - Added handleUndo and handleRedo functions
     - Added keyboard shortcuts for Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y
     - Updated shape creation calls to use wrappers
     - Updated shape deletion calls to use wrappers
   
   - `/collabcanvas/src/components/LeftSidebar.tsx`
     - Added Undo2 and Redo2 icon imports
     - Added props: onUndo, onRedo, canUndo, canRedo
     - Added Undo and Redo buttons in UI

## Design Decisions

### 1. Why Command Pattern?
- Clean separation between recording and execution
- Easy to extend with new operation types
- Simple undo/redo logic (just swap before/after)

### 2. Why Separate Undo/Redo Stacks?
- Standard pattern for history management
- Clear distinction between "done" and "undone" operations
- Clearing redo stack on new action is intuitive

### 3. Why 50-Entry Limit?
- Prevents memory issues with large canvases
- 50 operations is sufficient for most editing sessions
- Balances usability with performance

### 4. Why Record After Operation?
- Ensures operation succeeded before recording
- Avoids invalid history entries from failed operations
- Uses optimistic updates for shape finding (slight delay)

### 5. Why Not Record Stress Test?
- Creating 100 shapes would fill history stack
- Test operations aren't "user actions"
- Uses direct Firestore calls to bypass history

### 6. Why Not Record Clear Canvas?
- Bulk deletion with confirmation dialog
- Would create 100+ history entries
- Users understand this is a destructive operation

## Multiplayer Considerations

**History is Local Only**:
- Each user has their own undo/redo history
- Undoing your changes doesn't affect other users
- Other users see undo operations as normal create/update/delete

**Race Conditions**:
- Undo operations use Firestore's last-write-wins
- Object locking prevents conflicts during editing
- Toast notifications show success/failure

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Operations
- [x] Create shape → Undo → Shape deleted
- [x] Create shape → Undo → Redo → Shape recreated
- [x] Move shape → Undo → Shape returns to original position
- [x] Delete shape → Undo → Shape restored
- [x] Buttons disabled when no history

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [x] Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Z triggers undo
- [x] Cmd+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z triggers redo
- [x] Cmd+Y / Ctrl+Y triggers redo (Windows)
- [x] Shortcuts disabled during text editing

### UI Behavior
- [x] Undo button disabled when canUndo === false
- [x] Redo button disabled when canRedo === false
- [x] Buttons show correct tooltips
- [x] Buttons positioned below Cursor Mode button

### Edge Cases
- [x] Undo when another user deleted shape (handled gracefully)
- [x] Multiple sequential undos
- [x] Multiple sequential redos
- [x] Undo → new action → redo stack cleared
- [x] History survives component re-renders

## Performance Impact

**Minimal**:
- History entries are small objects (~200 bytes each)
- Max 50 entries = ~10 KB memory
- No impact on rendering or sync performance
- History recording is synchronous and fast

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple changes into single undo/redo
2. **History Persistence**: Save history to localStorage
3. **History Panel**: Show list of operations with descriptions
4. **Selective Undo**: Undo specific operations, not just last one
5. **Multi-User History**: Show other users' operations in history panel

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [x] Memory Bank (activeContext.md, progress.md)
- [ ] Main README.md
- [ ] TESTING_CHECKLIST.md (update Section 3 to include undo/redo)

## Summary

The Undo/Redo system is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Command pattern implementation
- ✅ History-aware wrapper functions
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- ✅ UI buttons in left sidebar
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback
- ✅ Proper handling of edge cases
- ✅ Zero linter errors

**Status**: Ready for production deployment and user testing.
